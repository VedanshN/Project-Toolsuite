How to Verify Your .git Folder?

    Git Studio works by analyzing the hidden .git directory inside your project. While you typically only need to upload your Root Project Folder, you can verify the existence of the .git folder using these steps:

On Windows:
    Open File Explorer to your project directory.
    Click the View tab in the top ribbon menu.
    Check the box labeled Hidden items. The .git folder will appear as a semi-transparent icon.
On macOS:
    Open Finder and navigate to your project directory.
    Press Command (⌘) + Shift + . (Period).
    Hidden files and folders, including .git, will instantly toggle visible.
